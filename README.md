1. We implemented both link state and distance vector algorithm
2. Test by given topologies show the correctness of our implemetation

Highlight:
- Timestamp is necessary for the link state message in the circular topology.
- Because in the circular topology, the old message may go a 
  circular loop and arrive later than the new message.
